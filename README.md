# **HAPPY HACKS - Introduction**

## ***Are you feeling in need of some happiness?***

> "*Even a happy life cannot be without a measure of darkness, and the word ‘happy’ would lose its meaning if it were not balanced by sadness. It is far better to take things as they come along with patience and equanimity*".
> 
> Carl Jung

So why not welcome youself to our *World Happiness Day Hackathon project*, also know as **Happy Hacks**? - a rejoiceful place, full of fun emojis and happy ideas for the world!

HAPPY HACKS is a place where users can receive inspirational '**Happy Hacks**', that they can use to motivate and guide themselves towards happiness, with advice from others. The home page invites users to click a button to receive a random 'hack', generated by other users. Users can create their own hacks by completing a form and attach an emoji to the post, sharing their own tips for the benefit of others. Hacks can be liked and the text and assciated emojis assist users in being able to filter posts for themed suggestions that are relevant to them.

## **DESIGN**

- Research indicated that the happiest colour was yellow, with oranges also featuring.
- We selected a palette of complimentary colours with a happy theme.
- Colours were selected using the coolors color palette generator.<br><br>

- Fonts were selected for their simple and readable design to avoid distracting from the content.
- Roboto Slab and Quicksand were selected.
- Later, Lilita One, was selected for the home page title for impact.
